              Familiar characters will return to the game, but also completely new
              ones. We are talking here about Thor, presented as a brutal and
              mentally unstable performer of "dirty work" in the services of Odin
              , as well as the ruler of the gods himself, who left his mark on the
              events of the previous installment, although he did not appear in it
              personally.
